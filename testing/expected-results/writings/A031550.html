It would have been a disgrace to the taste of the country had not this bold, original, highly picturesque composition attracted its just share of popularity and praise. But we shall not treat the composer unfairly if we venture to assert that the <span class="tei_sic">the<a class="noteMarker" id="ref-d22340e60" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" data-ref="d22340e60">‡</a></span> overture conveys by far too favourable an estimate of his talents, as applied to the music of the entire opera. With this, however, we have not at present much concern. We are now merely about to shew the rise and progress of the excessive attraction which has distinguished <a class="persons A002068" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068.html">Weber</a>’s great work in <span class=" 6911010310897110100"><span class="tei_country">England</span></span>. The success of the opera amongst the romantic natives of <span class=" 7110111410997110121"><span class="tei_country">Germany</span></span> was unbounded. One theatre alone is said to have received thirty thousand florins, on the nights of its representation, in a single season, and new reports of its transmission through the Conti<span class="tei_pb">|</span>nental cities and towns were continually reaching <span class=" 6911010310897110100"><span class="tei_country">England</span></span>. Under these predisposing circumstances it was determined to introduce it at the Eglish Opera House. Nor were the interests of the manager only concerned. We have it from unquestionable authority, that almost every German in <span class=" 76111110100111110"><span class="tei_settlement">London</span></span> was invited to attend on the first night of its representation, as a matter of honour to his contry, by the active interposition of <a class="persons A000775" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A000775.html">Mr. Hawes</a>.

                    it seems not to be wonderful that it should have seized so intensely upon the fancy for the public. The music, we are convinced by experience, had but a slight share in fixing its popularity, though the report of the music led the way to the introduction of the opera itself. Be this as it may, nothing now resounded in the theatres, and nothing could be found upon the counters of the music shops but <span class="works A020040" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020040.html"><span class="tei_hi_italic">Der Freyschutz</span></span>, and arrangements of Der Freyschutz. – "Voice, fiddle, and flute" were all employed, whilst <a class="persons A000775" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A000775.html">Mr. Hawes</a>, the apostle of <a class="persons A002068" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068.html">Weber</a>, (and the Royal Harmonic Instituion) made it a concert at <span class=" 76105118101114112111111108"><span class="tei_settlement">Liverpool</span></span>, and spread its renown through the provinces.

                                        <p>The intimate connection which the benefit concert of <a class="persons A000775" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A000775.html">Mr. Hawes</a> bears to this subject must be an apology for introducing it here.

If we had before believed that the music of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="works A020040" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020040.html">Der Freyschutz</span></span> was purely dramatic, and with the exception of the overture, depended on its connection with the mystical structure of the opera for effect, we were more than ever convinced of the justice of such a judgment from the result of <a class="persons A000775" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A000775.html">Mr. Hawes</a>’s concert. Nearly all that was not irresistibly ridiculous, was supremely dull.

The audience could with difficulty sit out the opera, and from <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="works A020023" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020023.html">Natur und Liebe</span></span> they continued to flee from its commencement. <a href="#footNote03">+</a> The first experi<span class="tei_pb">|</span>ment, we should presume, will be satisfactory–a second will never be made.</p>
                                        <p>But to come back to the oratorios. The losses which had driven former managers from the speculation would naturally caution the new undertakers against too considerable an expenditure. Accordingly the numbers and quality of the band, both vocal and instrumental, were reduced; and although the singers engaged were some of them of the first class, there was by no means that exuberant exhibition of talent which, at the same time that it attracted, satiated and fatigued the public on preceding occasion. We have but slight means of forming any judgment as to the profit and loss of the season–we believe it to have yielded a profit, particularly at Drury-lane, but so far as the music was concerned, it appears inferior to former years–nor were there many marks of good taste in the plan or the conduct. <a class="persons A002068" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068.html">Weber</a>’s music was to be made the instrument of attraction, which was the more easily done by the previous occupation of the general imagination through <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="works A020040" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020040.html">Der Freyschutz</span></span>. All the world perhaps knows that those who undertake the management of public amusements do so for the purpose of getting money. But still there is an accompanying notion that a certain quantity of judgment and a certain love of the arts and a desire for their advancement go along with the ruling motive. This is not always an illusion, and ought never to be so. But when it is, some care should be taken to conceal it. Very little of such a care could be discovered in the conduct of the oratorios at either house. The general prosperity of the times, rather than the particular excellence of the arrangements, may account for the partial success.</p>
                                        <p>The only permanent concerts this season were the Antient and the Philharmonic, and so uniform is the tenor of their course, that they afford little scope for remark. At the former <a class="persons A001646" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A001646.html">Mr. Sapio</a> was engaged–an innovation to which his success at <span class=" 89111114107"><span class="tei_settlement">York</span></span> was probably the leading cause. <span class=" 771051151153287105108107105110115111110">Miss Wilkinson</span>, a singer new to the orchestra, has also appeared there this season.</p>
                                        <p>This young lady is a descendant of the celebrated Tate Wilkinson, so long the manager of the <span class=" 89111114107328410410197116114101">York Theatre</span>. Her voice is a contralto of rich tone, but a little thick and throaty, and of moderate compass and volume. She has been taught we are told by <span class=" 831051031101111143283999711211297">Signor Scappa</span>, <a class="persons A005139" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A005139.html">Mr. Wm. Knyvett</a>, and lastly, by <span class=" 7711446327111410197116111114101120">Mr.<span class="tei_pb"> | </span> Greatorex</span>. Her style is smooth and to a certain degree polished, but at present it wants force and contrast, and consequently is limited in effect. We would be understood to speak with due reservation, for the first public efforts of any singer are entitled to great allowances. <span class=" 771051151153287105108107105110115111110">Miss Wilkinson</span> may however be considered by her long period of study to have arrived at almost all she is capable of attaining, except that ripening of the powers which springs from orchestral practice. But her debut must be esteemed exceedingly successful.</p>
                                        <p><span class=" 77971009710910132809711511697">Madame Pasta</span> was engaged during the short period of her stay. <a class="persons A008707" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A008707.html">Miss Stephens</a> and <span class=" 77105115115328411497118105115">Miss Travis</span>, with <span class=" 7711411546328397108109111110">Mrs. Salmon</span>, were there as usual. This latter singer, we regret to state, was compelled to retire at the beginning of May from all her engagements, by a failure of powers, which appears to be an effect upon the nervous system. <span class=" 7711411546328397108109111110">Mrs. Salmon</span>’s professional exertions during the last autumn had been incessant, and as her services were required at the most distant parts of the kingdom immediately in succession, her fatigue in travelling was proportionally great. In the early part of the season she was as much in request as ever in <span class=" 76111110100111110"><span class="tei_settlement">London</span></span>, and had begun to feel the consequences of over exertion, when the alarming illness of her mother assisted in completing what a too solicitous discharge of public duty gad begun, and her medical advisers declared absolute repose to be indispensable to her restoration; she therefore gave up all her engagements, and retired at once.<a href="#footNote04">*</a>

                                        <p><a class="persons A001474" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A001474.html">Mr. Phillips</a>, a young base singer, has also been engaged at the Antient Concert, and has occupied a very prominent place in the performances. His voice is moderately powerful and welltoned, yet not heavy nor indeed remarkable for any peculiar quality. But his style indicates an acute and energetic mind, and there are obvious fondations upon which a sound and elegant superstructure may be raised, while his modesty and industrious perseverance in the study of his art are powerful recommendations. <span class=" 669711411610810110997110">Bartleman</span>’s superiority, not less than his long standing, originated and preserved a taste for base singing, which has survived its author. Hence there is an auxious desire to<span class="tei_pb"> | </span> renew and perpetuate those sources of pleasure to which he gave existence. The business of <span class="tei_hi_italic">Polypheme, the Frost Scene, Saul and the Witch of Endor</span>, the music to <span class="tei_hi_italic">the Tempest</span> and to <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class=" 77979998101116104">Macbeth</span></span><a href="#footNote05">*</a>–all these owed their place to him, and with the tenacity with which the fancy dwells on favourite objects, there is probably a lurking preference for these fine compositions in the minds of the directors. Whether <a class="persons A001474" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A001474.html">Mr. Phillips</a> will be able to satisfy this appetite time must determine–he is not yet sufficiently matured, but we must do him the justice to declare, that since Bartleman, there has been no fresh candidate for his place who seems to put forth such wellsupported pretensions.</p>
                                        <p>Nothing new, in the strict sense of the term, can be introduced into the bills of these concerts, but glees, the composition of <span class=" 871019898101">Webbe</span> and <span class=" 681144632679710810899111116116">Dr. Callcott</span>, have this year been superadded. The policy and propriety of limiting the performances to the same things year after year may and has indeed been much questioned. And without derogating from the acknowledged excellence, the superior excellence of the stock pieces, a plea in favour of more extensive researches may yet be safely advanced. This year there has been a curious repetition of the same songs, but by different singers. Thus <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class=" 77971141161051103276117116104101114">Martin Luther</span>’s hymn</span> was first sung by <a class="persons A008707" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A008707.html">Miss Stephens</a>, and a night or two after by <span class=" 771051151153287105108107105110115111110">Miss Wilkinson</span>, and <span class="tei_hi_italic">Brave Jonathan</span> first by <span class=" 7711446326610110810897109121">Mr. Bellamy</span>, and subsequently by <span class=" 77114463280104105108108105112115">Mr. Phillips</span>. This is an experiment which can hardly be said to be quite considerate to the feelings of the parties. Thus a young singer like <span class=" 771051151153287105108107105110115111110">Miss Wilkinson</span> must be injured, and her reputation was injured by the immediate comparison she suffered with a voice so prac<span class="tei_pb">|</span>tised, ductile, and beautiful as that of <a class="persons A008707" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A008707.html">Miss Stephens</a>, in a song which calls forth all these qualities to their utmost stretch. It is perhaps incumbent upon the conductor, should the knowledge of these facts escape the memory of the director for the night, to assist in sparing the performers so delicate yet so decided a competition. A man who has the interst of the concert so deeply at heart as <span class=" 7711446327111410197116111114101120">Mr. Greatorex</span>, and who enjoys in so high a degree the esteem of the noble directors, has it in his power to arrange these little niceties, and sure we are it must be in his inclination to preclude all possible cause of exacerbation in the minds of those, who can but be aggrieved by so inadvertent an opposition of their powers, however high they may stand above the general taint of envy.</p>
                                        <p>The concerts of the Philnarmonic Society have had little to distinguish them this season from those of former years. Managed by directors of the highest professional eminence, who act as it were under the perpetual surveillance of an association, consisting of members already so distinguished in art as to render them tremblingly alive to every circumstance that may diminish their own or the general reputation, judgment, care, and discipline, are more likely to be excercised in their full force here than in almost any other similar situation. The laws repecting pieces by single instruments have been slightly relaxed, but this is the only deviation from former habitudes we have discovered. But whilst the instrumental music is here above all praise, the vocal is certainly less an object of attention than it ought to be. The truth probably is, that the directors having engaged the finest talent, consider that the employment of their abilities to the best advantage may be safely devolved upon the singers themselves. Experience proves the contrary.</p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>The domain of the English theatre has been almost wholly occupied by <a class="persons A002068" href="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068.html">Weber</a> and <span class="works A020040" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020040.html"><span class="tei_hi_italic">Der Freyschutz</span></span>.

                                        <p>But in truth music has by no means the importance in our musical drama that should apperatain to it. Nothing proves this more strongly than the attractiveness of the German melo-drame. Nor can it be otherwise until a just perception of the intrinsic beauties of opera be generally diffused, until a true taste be cultivated, until indeed, a portion of that patronage which has been for a century past dedicated to the planting and maintaining a theatre for an Italian, be addressed to the establishment and support of an English opera. An earnest desire for national honour in art, evinced by such a patronage, might induce our great poets and musicians to combine for so worthy, so noble a purpose; but till this be done, our stages are not likely to exhibit any thing beyond the same anomalous jargon of dialogue and song, the same heterogenous mixture of nonsense and show, which at once disgraces and most effectually stops the progress of national taste, and reduces our composers and our artists either to imperfect imitators, or to the comparative disregard of the public.</p>
                                        <p>The usurpation of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="works A020040" data-ref="/exist/apps/WeGA-WebApp/de/A002068/Werke/A020040.html">Der Freyschutz</span></span> has necessarily very much precluded the introduction of new vocalists. <span class=" 77105115115327111497100100111110">Miss Graddon</span> gas appeared at <span class=" 681141171141214510897110101">Drury-lane</span>, as a first singer, with considerable approbation.

A part of it is to be a trio between two owls and a wolf, by which the town is to be enraptured.

This great idol of the public admiration sat near the door at the lower end of the room–but no sonner had the music begun than the general observation of all around was turned towards her, in remembrance of her consummate excellence in the Queen of English Tragedy–the Lady Macbeth. When the first strains were heard, her eye recalled some of its accustomed fires, and as the music proceeded, we thought we perceived, by a gradual elevation of port, the majesty of former hours renewed in her mind, which though not quite extinguished, seemed soon to be quelled by some internal sense that this mortal triumph was past. We trust however that this distinguished woman will live many years to enjoy such occasional gleams of recollected greatness, reflected back upon her from that public whose delight she so long formed, while she remained the wonder and the glory of her art.</li>
