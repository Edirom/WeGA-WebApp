                    Idiosynkratische WeGA Elemente wie <code>workName</code> werden in ein generisches <code>name</code>-Element überführt,

                <p> 
                    TEI simplePrint ist eine TEI-Anpassung speziell für "Einsteiger", die auf die Anforderungen von westeuropäischen, gedruckten Texten der Neuzeit ausgelegt ist. 
                    (vgl. <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/">http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/</a>).
                    Diese Anpassung erleichtert das Prozessieren und Darstellen der Inhalte, allerdings können nicht alle Konzepte der WeGA verlustfrei in dieses Format überführt werden. Daher an dieser Stelle eine Warnung, dass dies ein <i>verlustbehaftetes</i> Exportformat ist. 
                </p>

                    Der Versuch, eine einfache plain-text-Variante zur Verfügung zu stellen.
                    Alle Lesarten, Abkürzungen etc. sind aufgelöst und die Textstruktur ist lediglich durch Leerzeilen angedeutet.

                    Music, properly so called, may now be divided into two species. The most pleasing in its immediate effects, and therefore the most popular is that which is distinguished by melody. This acts directly upon the sense, and as a picture that represents a varied prospect in vivid colours catches and delights the eye of the beholder, in like manner animated traits of melody take the ear and the fancy of the auditor at once, and occasion much of pleasureable excitement from direct and absolute impression. Whether it be expressive of the subject or expressive at all, is neither enquired nor thought of. The ear is gratified, the imagination roused, the spirits are elevated, and all the purposes of listening to music, in the common acceptation of the term, are fulfilled. The early masters of dramatic song, and even those down to a late period, certainly aimed at just expression, but they seldom if ever failed to consider melody as the great light which must illuminate their system. They did not however possess the same extended means of producing new and extraordinary effects that modern science and a modern orchestra afford, though studious of enriching their ground-work of air by all the aids they could derive from harmony. The use which they made of accompaniment shows that their knowledge and their power grew with the growth of instrumental perfection. Still however the composers of this class adhered to the principle of unity as much as possible—they sought the brilliant and the beautiful for present effect—for effect upon the sense, and through the sense upon the fancy, thus creating scarcely more than physical excitement and its usual concomitants. Down to <a class="preview persons A001616" href="">Rossini</a>, the most popular composer of dramatic music that ever existed, the same practice has obtained. These are principally Italians, or followers of the Italian school.

                    But another race has sprung up which constitutes our second<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 85"> | </span> species. By the phrase we employ it should seem we consider the family to be one of recent date. This however is by no means the case. For perhaps the very oldest writers for the church, those who studied fugue, canon, and contrivance, the writers in forty parts, in short the writers of music for the mind, for study and reflection were the real founders of the school. Leaving this point to the curious, we proceed to the distinctions which especially mark the compositions of the <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">illustrious man</a> whose latest work we are about to examine, who is the greatest and perhaps the most original and peculiar of the German school. <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Carl Maria Von Weber</a> has indeed instituted a new musical philosophy, for that is the true description—his is the music of thought as well as inspiration—he enquires deeply into the foundation of the human affections—he traces the laws of association, and follows them into practice—he endeavours to discover the relations between the physical and the metaphysical union of art and mind, and to combine all these elements, and work them together, not only into the pleasureable enjoyment of the moment, but to carry them on and perpetuate these emotions by reflection, is the great and permanent distinction to which he aspires. With this view he does not entirely disregard, but he holds the lighter graces of the Italian manner of writing, of that school we have already described, to be comparatively subordinate and superficial. He would be remembered as well as heard, and relished and approved as well as remembered. He employs his strength then upon the grand and solid parts.—Hence the deep consideration, arrangement, and continuity of his designs—hence the unity to be discovered throughout each of his works—hence those traits which are but as links of the chain of thought—hence the masterly combinations that are contrived not only to impress and to express, but which to be understood, demand the whole force of the attention. Neither must it ever be forgotten that the subjects<a href="#footnote01" id="backref-footnote01" class="fn-ref">*</a> <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> has been called upon or has chosen to illustrate by<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 86"> | </span> music, are those of an ideal creation—the highest task of that fine phrenzy which

                    The genius of harmony which awaits his call may be well supposed to rise instant at the summons, and to address him as that fine apparition, the quaint <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="65114105101108">Ariel</span></span>, addresses the magic-working <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="80114111115112101114111">Prospero</span></span>—

                    The success of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020040" href="">Der Freischutz</a></span> had made its <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">author’s</a> name so popular in <span class="tei_country">England</span>, that nothing could appear to promise greater eclat, than to engage him to compose and to bring him over to conduct the music for one of the great theatres. At this critical juncture, <a class="preview persons A000992" href="">Mr. C. Kemble</a>, one of the proprietors of <span class="tei_placeName">Covent Garden</span>, had determined upon accompanying <a class="preview persons A001835" href="">Sir George Smart</a> in a tour through <span class="tei_country">Germany</span>—a tour which may well be termed a tour of inspection, because health, relaxation, and pleasure, were not perhaps so much the objects as the view these artists had to better their professional knowledge, by a personal acquaintance with the progress of the drama and of music in that country of philosophers. They therefore made every possible enquiry, and left nothing unsought or unseen that pertained to the subjects of their pursuit. The first public result appears to have been the engagement of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Carl Maria Von Weber</a> to support by his presence in <span class="tei_country">England</span> the reputation he had already gained. The piece he was to work upon was drawn from the poetical visions of one of the most inspired of his own countrymen, <a class="preview persons A002357" href="">Wieland</a>—the time, the proudest age of chivalry. Its machinery embraces the spirits of air, earth, fire, and ocean, while the rapid<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 87"> | </span> transference of the hero from clime to clime by this magical agency, affords range and scope for as illimitable flights of the imagination, in adapting the decorative parts (amongst which for a moment we shall include the music) to the illusive and changeful manners of the story. The finest singers the English stage has to boast, upheld the fame of the <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">composer</a>, and every accessory that embellishment could add, was assembled to give him honour due, to stimulate his genius, and dignify the theatre and the occasion. Last not least, <a class="preview persons A001487" href="">Mr. Planché</a>, who has proved the power of his ability in lyric and dramatic adaptation, was employed to fit the poem for the stage. And as he could hardly fail to feel the distinction, so he has expressed his homage to the <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">musician</a> for whom he has written with great modesty and elegance in his preface to <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>.
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    “The story on which this <a class="preview works A020045" href="">opera</a> is founded, (says <a class="preview persons A001487" href="">Mr. P.</a>) appeared originally in that famous collection of French romances, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">“</span><a class="noteMarker" id="ref-d10e194" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" data-ref="#d10e194">‡</a></span>La Bibliothèque Bleue,’ under the title of ‘Huon of Bourdeaux.’ <a class="preview persons A002357" href="">Wieland</a> adopted the principal incidents, and weaving them into a web of his own, composed his justly celebrated poem of ‘<span class="tei_hi_italic">Oberon</span>,’ which has been tastefully translated into English by <a class="preview persons A000C2E" href="">Mr. Sotheby</a>. The subject has been frequently dramatized, twice at least in <span class="tei_country">Germany</span>, and twice in <span class="tei_country">England</span>, not counting a masque by <a class="preview persons A000C2E" href="">Mr. Sotheby</a> himself, which I believe was never acted. At the <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Baron Von Weber’s</a> desire, the task has been again attempted; and I am indebted principally to <a class="preview persons A000C2E" href="">Mr. Sotheby</a>’s elegant version for the plot of the piece; but the demerits of the dialogue and lyrical portions must be visited on my head: they are presented to the public but as the fragile threads on which a great composer has ventured to string his valuable pearls; and fully conscious of the influence that thought has had on my exertions, I feel that, even as regards these threads—
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">If aught like praise to me belong,</span><span class="verseLine">With <span class="tei_hi_italic">him</span> I must divide it;</span><span class="verseLine">‘I am not the rose,’ says the Persian song,</span><span class="verseLine">‘But I have dwelt beside it.’”</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    Such is the history of this performance. Two acts, at least, were composed we believe in <span class="tei_country">Germany</span>—it was finished in the house of <a class="preview persons A001835" href="">Sir George Smart</a>, where <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Mr. Weber</a> has been a guest since the early part of March, when he arrived in <span class="tei_country">England</span>.<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 88"> | </span>

                    With the avidity of knowledge and the ease of attainment natural to genius, the <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">composer</a> had studied our tongue, and so perfectly does he seem to have mastered the accent, that throughout this entire <a class="preview works A020045" href="">work</a> we have detected very few and slight inaccuracies. Still however we must consider that a foreign language must detract from the enthusiasm which ought to fire the composer in the moment of inspiration, since many of the finest filaments of association that link thought to thought by their viewless agency, must be lost and broken. Again, although the English are allied to the Germans by a similarity of character, the latter appear to have risen to a degree of intensity in their taste for the romantic and mystical dramas and of science in their musical combinations, which either we have not yet attained or have long since rejected. There are other disadvantages against which he has contended. When the principal parts of <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a> were written, he had little other acquaintance with the powers of his singers than the scale of their compass exhibited. Some changes of considerable importance have been even since made, such as the substitution of <a class="preview persons A002014" href="">Madame Vestris</a> for <a class="preview persons A00242F" href="">Miss Tree</a>, <a class="preview persons A000211" href="">Mr. Braham</a> for <span class="771144632831051109910897105114">Mr. Sinclair</span>, <a class="preview persons A000281" href="">Miss H. Cawse</a> for <a class="preview persons A008150" href="">Master Longhurst</a>. These however cannot be deemed to be unfavourable, except perhaps that the greater talent of two of the former might have afforded him greater scope and facility. There was no base singer, and thus <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> was deprived of a voice for which he has written very effectively. Now to the story itself. The principal characters are—

One of the properties of the cup is to detect misconduct. He offers it to <span class="66979810110797110">Babekan</span>. On raising it to his lips, the wine turns to flame, and thus proves him a villain; he attempts to assassinate <span class="72117111110">Huon</span>, but is put to flight. The Knight then learns from an old woman that the Princess is to be married next day, but that <span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span> has been worked on like her lover by a vision, and is resolved to be his alone; she believes that fate will protect her from her nuptials with <span class="66979810110797110">Babekan</span>, which are to be solemnized on the next day. <span class="72117111110">Huon</span> enters, fights with and vanquishes <span class="66979810110797110">Babekan</span>, and having spell-bound the rest by the blast of the magic horn, he and <span class="8310410111497115109105110">Sherasmin</span> carry off <span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span> and <span class="709711610510997">Fatima</span>.

                    It will be immediately seen and understood, that a composition which aspires to set off and illustrate the train of changeful situation and circumstances appertaining to such a story as this, must be at once mystical and imaginative. It must employ all the resources of art by turns, and still preserve certain traits, that by their re-appearance may serve to keep alive the principal idea (the supernatural agency) in the midst of the distracting diversity. It will also perhaps strike the examiner, that harmony and instrumental combination would be a stronger and more effectual agent than melody, though melody must always be the popular charm of music, and that from the often-repeated character of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber’s</a> previous productions, such would be the principle upon which he would work. For it cannot have escaped any one who has given the slightest attention to the genius of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">this composer’s</a> works, that his conceptions are, as we have before described them, at once lofty and full of high phantasy, yet never losing sight of the philosophy of his art or of its deepest science. Hence at once the praise which always follows him, and the censure which sometimes mixes with the commendation. 
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber’s</a> overtures, though they may be thought to be the first in point of estimation, are always the last in their production, for they take their chief characteristics from the opera itself, leading the mind to embrace as it were the general action. This<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 90"> | </span> property it is that makes them so acceptable to the public, not only in their proper place, but as orchestral music. The overture to <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020040" href="">Der Freischutz</a></span>,<a href="#footnote02" id="backref-footnote02" class="fn-ref">*</a> before we have seen the piece, raises trains of indefinitely wild images and emotions, stimulating the mind to wander in search of the meaning of such “mysterious harpings.” When the opera has been heard, the book lies open—the connection is manifest, and associations are established, as full of fiery shapes as the drama itself. Of such a kind is the one before us.
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    The overture we have said is so completely framed upon <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>, that perhaps our analysis would be better understood, were we like <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the author</a> to consider its construction in the last instead of the first place. It is in D major, and opens the main subject of <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the piece</a> at once by a solo for the horn, which forms the symphony of the vision of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, and indeed gives the second title to <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the piece</a>, being one of the great magical agents. This consists of five bars only, and a few notes lead to a short trait from the chorus of Fairies, taken by flutes, which presents to us these wayward agents of the night. A martial strain from the movement, played in the Court of <span class="671049711410810110997103110101">Charlemagne</span> (the last scene) introduces the hero, and we are to gather his success from the union of this passage with a part of the trio, which is sung before the lovers embark from Ascalon. These, with their transitions and a passage from <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="821011051229739115">Reiza’s</span></span> scena in the second act, carry us on to <span class="801179910739115">Puck’s</span> invocation of the spirits. Here we have the preternatural cause of the shipwreck and subsequent distresses of the lovers pourtrayed to us, and these musical themes, variously wrought, form the rest of the overture, which concludes with the melody from <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="821011051229739115">Reiza’s</span></span> scena, and like the story, happily. If we say that this composition does not equal the overture to <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020040" href="">Der Freischutz</a></span>, it cannot we presume excite the least surprise, for when has the genius of the musician produced any thing so darkly mysterious, so finely descriptive, so linked together by unity of plan and execution, so rich in its combinations, so powerful in its dominion over the soul? The one before us is certainly original in conception, and it gains on us by repetition, but neither the traits of melody nor the harmonical combinations are sufficiently beautiful<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 91"> | </span> nor frequent to enchain the mind of the hearer like those former works, with which it cannot escape comparison. 
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    <a class="preview works A020045" href="">The piece</a> itself opens with <span class="799810111411111039115">Oberon’s</span> bower, and here we must so far digress as to inform the reader that all that “can cheat the eye with blear illusion,” has been most tastefully applied. The stage is filled with “the pert fairies and the dapper elves,” who trip in such wild yet soft and measured movement, that never did the moon-beams fall on daintier sprites. We shall quote <a class="preview persons A001487" href="">Mr. Planché’s</a> poetry, to show he has sustained his part.
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">Light as fairy foot can fall,</span><span class="verseLine">Pace, ye elves, your master’s hall;</span><span class="verseLine">All too loud the fountains play,</span><span class="verseLine">All too loud the zephyrs sigh;</span><span class="verseLine">Chase the noisy gnat away,</span><span class="verseLine">Keep the bee from humming by.</span><span class="verseLine">Stretch’d upon his lilly bed,</span><span class="verseLine"><span class="7998101114111110">Oberon</span> in slumber lies;</span><span class="verseLine">Sleep, at length, her balm hath shed</span><span class="verseLine">O’er his long-unclosed eyes.</span><span class="verseLine">O, may her spell as kindly bring</span><span class="verseLine">Peace to the heart of the fairy king!</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    The music of this chorus is amongst the happiest conceptions (if it be not the <span class="tei_hi_italic">most</span> felicitous) in <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>. The voices are all soprani, the parts syllabic and melodious, and the light strains for the dance intervene as symphonies. Nothing certainly can be more elegantly descriptive. 
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    We cannot say as much for the song of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="7998101114111110">Oberon</span></span> (“<span class="tei_hi_italic">Fatal Vow</span>.”) It pourtrays the anguish and dark passions which vex the spirit, but too darkly as it seems to our notion of the subject for such a being. Nor are we struck with the vision. It would be a simple melody, but is quaint, and appears rather the offspring of thought than feeling. The next fairy chorus, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Honour and joy to the true and the brave</span>,” is very effective. It is interspersed by solos for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="7998101114111110">Oberon</span></span> and <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, and one “<span class="tei_hi_italic">The sun is kissing the purple tide</span>,” for the first has one of those traits of melody which are scattered like flowers on our path here and there. The chorus is at last wrought into an <span class="tei_hi_italic">allegro</span>, the fairies singing an incitation to <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, while the knight has a separate subject (a bravura) running against the syllabic choral part. There are certainly both force and effect throughout. Next follows the <span class="tei_hi_italic">aria d’abilità</span>, given to <a class="preview persons A000211" href="">Mr. Braham</a>, which we must<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 92"> | </span> consider to be any thing but worthy either of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> or the <a class="preview persons A000211" href="">singer</a>. To our ears the introductory and concluding parts were noisy and vulgar, and little besides. The fullness of the accompaniment compelled <a class="preview persons A000211" href="">Mr. B.</a> to desperate vociferation, tore his tone to tatters, and produced no sensation but pity and pain. The andante in the middle, though smooth and better, cannot redeem the movements between which it stands. There are two modes of writing such a song—in pure syllabic declamation or in divisions. <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> adhered to the former, but scarcely with his usual discrimination. The syllabic method may be, and is more true to nature; but it is in such songs that the licence of musical embellishment may be curiously indulged, and especially when the composer has such an agent as <a class="preview persons A000211" href="">Braham</a>. 
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    A scena for <a class="preview persons A001448" href="">Miss Paton</a> comes next as if to bring the powers of the hero and heroine into immediate contact and contrast. <a class="preview persons A001448" href="">The lady</a> has however by far the best of the contest, the materials assigned her being much more agreeable, though still not of the highest cast. But we shall cite the principal subject of her song as having a singularity that is worth preserving. 
                </p><span class="tei_notatedMusic"><a href="https://weber-gesamtausgabe.de/Scaler/IIIF/%2Fwritings%2FA0316xx%2FA031667%2FYesMyLord.png/full/full/0/native.jpg"><img alt="Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review, 1826, S. 92" src="https://weber-gesamtausgabe.de/Scaler/IIIF/%2Fwritings%2FA0316xx%2FA031667%2FYesMyLord.png/full/,75/0/native.jpg" /></a></span>
                                        <p>
                    But there is a fault in this song which is common to <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the author</a>. It is too long—repeats too much, and even when there is diversity, that diversity is not sufficiently varied. This leaves the expression<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 93"> | </span> of sameness and heaviness. We have called this a scena, but the air in truth is only the introduction to the <span class="tei_hi_italic">finale</span> of the first act. A dialogue duet succeeds, in which the base, by its mysterious movement, becomes the principal feature, and especially by the transition to G minor near the close, before the parts unite in the <span class="tei_hi_italic">allegro vivace</span>. The melody of this has nothing touching, and it lacks the lightness and grace that renders treble duets effective. But in the chorus appended, the genius of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> is to be recognized. The combinations to the following words are most judicious and striking.

                    The charm lies in the continual recurrence of the passage at foot, which appears with uncommon force in the various parts of the accompaniment.  
                </p><span class="tei_notatedMusic"><a href="https://weber-gesamtausgabe.de/Scaler/IIIF/%2Fwritings%2FA0316xx%2FA031667%2FNB_2.png/full/full/0/native.jpg"><img alt="Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review, 1826, S. 93" src="https://weber-gesamtausgabe.de/Scaler/IIIF/%2Fwritings%2FA0316xx%2FA031667%2FNB_2.png/full/,75/0/native.jpg" /></a></span>

                    With this passage it is to be observed commences a transition, very finely brought in from the key of E with three flats, to C natural. The soprano at the close has a separate melody, which is principal and brilliant, while the choral parts go on under it. This is one of the very few things that reconcile us to the belief of the possibility of introducing legitimate finales into English operas with success. Most certainly the finale parts of this are<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 94"> | </span> amongst the happiest in the entire <a class="preview works A020045" href="">piece</a>. The martial but sombre melody of the march is completely characteristic.

                                        <p>
                    The second act calls into more vivid action the preternatural agency which <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> delights to illustrate. This music therefore rises. It opens with a chorus (<span class="tei_hi_italic">Glory to the Caliph</span>) which commences in B<span class="musical-symbols">♮</span>  minor, and changes afterwards very effectively into C major. It is also remarkable for its rhythmical iteration of two quavers and a crotchet, which conveys the accent almost throughout. It reminds us of a part of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020227" href="">Preciosa</a></span>, but is nevertheless very much of the same character as the preceding chorus, to which it bears an analogy, from being sung by the slaves of the Caliph. “<span class="tei_hi_italic">A lonely Arab maid</span>,” a song for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="709711610510997">Fatima</span></span>, consists of an andante in E minor and a movement in the major, but contains nothing of especial note.
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Over the dark blue waters</span>” is amongst the most attractive pieces in <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>. The opening (<span class="tei_hi_italic">Allegro con grazia</span>) consists of two responsive solos in duet, first for the base and tenor, and secondly for the sopranos. Its style accords with the marginal direction, for it is at once free and graceful, with an originality in the structure of the passages, that interests the ear while it engages the attention. When the four parts come in, it rises to the more animated movement which is taken as the principal subject of the overture, and which here in its first and natural position is very exhilarating. In the rolling base passage towards the end (page 83, staff 1), <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> gives a strong proof of his regard to instrumental effects—for it strikes us that many composers would have transferred so much of it as the voice could execute to the vocal part.
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    We now arrive at a portion of <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a> where it may be literally said appear those “fiery shapes,” which have formed the delight and the fame of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a>. The scene is the invocation of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8011799107">Puck</span></span> to the spirits, whom he summons to raise a storm and sink the vessel in which the lovers are embarked. It begins with a recitative, more powerful than the general tenor of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber’s</a> writing in this species. Then follows an <span class="tei_hi_italic">allegro pesante</span> to the following poetical lines:
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">Whether ye be in the cavern dark,</span><span class="verseLine">Lighted alone by the diamond spark,</span><span class="verseLine">Or beneath the waters deep,</span><span class="verseLine">Where the prisoned pearl doth sleep,<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 95"> | </span></span><span class="verseLine">Or in skies beyond the one</span><span class="verseLine">Mortal eyes do look upon,</span><span class="verseLine">Or in the womb of some groaning hill,</span><span class="verseLine">Where the lava-stream is boiling still—</span><span class="verseLine">Spirits, wherever ye chance to be,</span><span class="verseLine">Come hither, come hither, come hither to me;</span><span class="verseLine">I charge ye by the magic ring</span><span class="verseLine">Of your faithful friend, the fairy king.</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    The musical effect is drawn from the modulation, which is unusually frequent. But when the spirits answer the call, the stage, nay earth and air seem to be peopled with ideal shapes. The mountain which forms the entire flat (we believe is the theatrical phrase) at the back is divided into countless cells, from which issue all the pigmy inhabitants, while the stage itself is filled with the airy creation of the spirits of other elements. The movement is a rapid presto, but the vocal parts are syllabic. There are one or two striking proofs of the character of deep thought, which is so peculiar to <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a>. To the demand
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">We are here! we are here!</span><span class="verseLine">Say, what must be done?</span><span class="verseLine">Must we cleave the moon’s sphere?</span><span class="verseLine">Must we darken the sun?</span><span class="verseLine">Must we empty the ocean upon its own shore?</span><span class="verseLine">Speak! speak! we have pow’r to do this and more!</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    <span class="8011799107">Puck</span> replies—
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">Nay, nay, your task will be, at most,</span><span class="verseLine">To wreck a bark upon this coast,</span><span class="verseLine">Which simple fairy may not do,</span><span class="verseLine">And therefore have I summon’d you!</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    The spirits answer—
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">Nought but that? Ho, ho, ho, ho!</span><span class="verseLine">Lighter labour none we know.</span><span class="verseLine">Winds and waves obey the spell!</span><span class="verseLine">Hark! ’tis done! Farewell! farewell!</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    The passage that we would cite is the first line, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Nought but that</span>.” Upon these words <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> has put all the orchestra and the singers into unison, obviously to display the simplicity and easiness of the allotted task—and again in the words,
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">“Winds and waves obey the spell,”</span></span>
                                        <p>
                    the voices are in unison, and in slow protracted notes, each occupying a bar, to declare the solemnity of the purpose, while the trembling of the instruments convey the first effect as it were of the agency upon the surrounding objects. This is certainly very masterly and very expressive. The storm then rises, and the<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 96"> | </span> orchestra is made the vehicle of the elementary confusion. Like the sea-bird in the tempest, <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> seems to delight in the flash of the lightning, the roar of the thunder, and the heavings of ocean, while he rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.
                </p>
                                        <p>
                    The adjuration of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span> is a short and feeling strain, but not in the happiest manner of the author, and is followed by “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Ocean thou mighty monster</span>,” a grand scena for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span></span>. Considered merely as a descriptive piece, this song is powerful, and perhaps it ought not to be regarded in any other light. The scena represents the gradual calm of the troubled waters, the breaking of the sun through the gloom, and the arrival of a boat to the succour of the distressed <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span></span>. All these natural circumstances, with the sensations they create in her bosom, form the subject of the scena, and <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> has strictly adhered to the intention of adapting it to the sole purpose of dramatic effect. The recitative is the part which calls for the greatest exertion of <span class="tei_hi_italic">vocal</span> talent. It is powerfully conceived. The allegro then presents to the ear (as the scenery to the eye) the distant rolling of the yet angry billows, and the gradual re-appearance of light. In this movement an instance of false accent occurs. In the line, “Through the gloom their white foam flashing,” the emphasis falls on THE and THEIR. At the end of the allegro there is a recitative to describe the busting forth of the sun, and the very fine <span class="tei_hi_italic">andante maestoso</span> which succeeds, seems to catch at the instant a portion of the warmth and light of the glaring orb, and to increase in dignity as the object it depicts increases in splendour. It is however curious that <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> should have described the setting sun by a rising passage. The only way in which this treatment can be accounted for is upon the supposition that <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> purposes to convey the flood of glory bursting through the skies, till, as is the natural fact in tropical climtes,
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">“With disk like battle target, red,</span><span class="verseLine">He rushes to his burning bed,</span><span class="verseLine">Dyes the wide wave with bloody light,</span><span class="verseLine">Then sinks at once, and all is night.”</span></span>

                    <a class="preview persons A001487" href="">Mr. Planchè</a> may probably have unconsciously had this image of <span class="8399111116116">Scott</span> in his mind when he wrote his lines, and the concluding musical phrase seems to give the elucidation we have hazarded.<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 97"> | </span>

                    An animated movement, at the appearance of the boat, contrasts with the andante, but the last part of this song is decidedly too instrumental; the melody which concludes it is not vocal, and it lies too high, and requires too much effort in order to overcome the force of the accompaniments. The immense effect sought in this scene requires a far more powerful agent than the voice, but every possible assistance from the orchestra is given, and it is in descriptive music that <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber’s</a> forte lies.

                    The <span class="10910111410997105100">mermaid</span>’s song, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">O ’tis pleasant</span>,” is a beautiful and smooth piece of melody, and to poetic dream recalls the memory of the Siren of old—
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">“Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,</span><span class="verseLine">That the rude sea grew civil at her song.”</span></span>

                    “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Master, say</span>,” a duet between <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="7998101114111110">Oberon</span></span> and <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8011799107">Puck</span></span>, follows, and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">and</span><a class="noteMarker" id="ref-d10e988" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" data-ref="#d10e988">‡</a></span> is one of the prettiest things in <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>. The opening to the finale of this act, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Who would stay in her coral cave</span>,” describes most effectively the “mustering of spirits.” The chorus itself is beautifully imagined, and the effect is left to the voices, which cannot do justice to its delicacy and grace—however sweet, they can hardly be sweet enough. The scene itself is enchanting. It is moonlight on the sea shore, which is covered by fairies,<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 98"> | </span> whilst the sea itself bears its nymphs, most beautifully grouped, and sailing over its calm surface in their “emerald cars.”

                    The first piece in the third act, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">O Araby, dear Araby</span>,” is a song for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="709711610510997">Fatima</span></span>, consisting of two movements, an andante and allegro—the first plaintive as the memory of joys that are past, the second, lively, like the hope that survives even in slavery—for such are the feelings and the situation it is intended to pourtray. We have good reason to believe that this air was a favourite with its <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">author</a>, who was the last man in the world to over-value his own productions; but he esteemed this to have some claim to originality, even at this time of day. If it have such a claim, it lies in the position of the accent in the melody upon the burden, “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Al, al, al</span>,” whenever these words occur, as well as in the melody itself. As sung by <a class="preview persons A002014" href="">Madame Vestris</a>, this trifle (for such it must be esteemed when compared with the more lofty and ambitious parts of the opera) is always amongst the most pleasing to the audience. It is loved like a child who engages by its playfulness. We can scarcely decide whether the duet which succeeds was or was not intended to be comic by <a class="preview persons A001487" href="">the poet</a> and <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a>—the words certainly indicate such a design, and the music of the first strain given to <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8310410111497115109105110">Sherasmin</span></span> it allied to the comic species; but when we find in the response of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="709711610510997">Fatima</span></span> the major converted into the minor, and a plaintive character substituted both in the melody and accompaniment, a curious difference (we will not call it an anomaly) is presented. Both however agree in determining to be “merry” as “true,” and the duet accordingly closes lightly. This portion is however a little too much drawn out.

                    “<span class="tei_hi_italic">And must I then dissemble</span>” is a trio of great originality, which by the pure force of its simplicity and beauty turns a situation of no importance into one of comparatively deep interest. It is sung by <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="709711610510997">Fatima</span></span>, and <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8310410111497115109105110">Sherasmin</span></span>, on discovering that <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span></span> is in the power of the Emir of Tunis, to these words:
                </p><span class="lg"><span class="verseLine">And must I then dissemble;</span><span class="verseLine">No other hope I know;</span><span class="verseLine">But let the tyrant tremble—</span><span class="verseLine">Unscathed he shall not go.</span><span class="verseLine">Viewless spirit of power and light,</span><span class="verseLine">Thou who mak’st virtue and love thy care,</span><span class="verseLine">Restore to the best and the bravest knight</span><span class="verseLine">The fondest and fairest of all the fair;—</span><span class="verseLine">Spirit adored, strike on our part—</span><span class="verseLine">Bless the good sword and the faithful heart!<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 99"> | </span></span></span>
                                        <p>
                    This is made into a beautiful cantabile prayer, with very simple accompaniments, and purely vocal.

                    “<span class="tei_hi_italic">Mourn thou poor heart</span>” is a short but expressive cavatina for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span></span>, in F minor. In this there is no execution—there are no difficult or unvocal distances—all is smooth, flowing, and pathetic. The accompaniment is of the same character.

                    A rondo for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, (“<span class="tei_hi_italic">I revel in joy and hope again</span>”) is designed to convey the rapture of unbounded satisfaction, but the song is over-wrought, and the passages are consequently stiff and not very graceful. There is a good deal of mannerism, particularly in the accompaniments, and it is too long.

                                        <p>
                    The next is the scene of <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8310511432721171111108217115">Sir Huon’s</span></span> temptation, when amidst the luxurious softness of the haram he is beset by the attendants of <span class="tei_hi_italic">Roshana</span>, who dance around and enwreath him with flowers. The strains they sing are voluptuous and bewitching. The solos for the knight, in which he breaks away from their allurements, are powerful and effective, but deformed by the mannerism of a too frequent use of chromatics, and of a tremando accompaniment. The choral parts are however those which absorb the attention.

                                        <p>
                    In the last scene <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span> and <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8210110512297">Reiza</span></span> are bound to the stake, and are surrounded by black slaves bearing torches, when suddenly <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="8310410111497115109105110">Sherasmin</span></span> blows the magic horn, which sets them all dancing. The chorus sung by the slaves is very ingenious; it is in D major, and begins by a few piano notes from the horn, which gradually swell into a chorus, and one of which the whole melody consists of <span class="tei_hi_italic">five notes</span>—but its simplicity bestows its effect, and we must further add, that the analogy before observed in the two chorusses of black slaves in the first and second acts is preserved in the present. It changes at length into a quartet for the four principal characters, on the same subject. <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="7998101114111110">Oberon</span></span> appears, and takes his farewell in a short but characteristic recitative and air, and having transported the principal dramatis personæ to the hall of <span class="671049711410810110997103110101">Charlemagne</span>, he vanishes. This scene is splendid; a spirited march, part of which is in the overture, opens it; one of the best recitatives in the whole <a class="preview works A020045" href="">piece</a> obtains <span class="67104971141081011099710311010139115">Charlemagne’s</span> pardon for <span class="tei_hi_italic"><span class="831051143272117111110">Sir Huon</span></span>, and <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a> closes by a finale of great brilliancy, the originality of which is derived from the base, which forms the support and ground-work of the whole, and is of a very decided character.<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 100"> | </span>
                </p>
                                        <p>Such is the imperfect analysis of <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the last considerable work</a> of <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Carl Maria Von Weber</a>. We readily admit that it is and must be imperfect, because in the first place it is impracticable fully to comprehend the effects of the score from the study of any arrangement, and next because <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber’s</a> compositions, and this perhaps more than any, are to be judged as musical rather by the instrumental combinations than by any other part, and as philosophical by their position and adaptation to the scene and the passion. In truth, the first time we heard <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a>, we abandoned the singers and listened almost entirely to the orchestra, for it could not escape the most casual observer, that it was there he had  “placed the statue.” In these combinations there is originality force, and effect. The expressiveness of the whole so much depends upon them, that <a class="preview works A020045" href="">the opera</a> must be heard to be understood, and as we have before said, must be understood to be relished. But while we give the highest credit to the deep thought which <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">the composer</a> has bestowed upon <a class="preview works A020045" href="">his work</a>, and the science that reigns throughout, we cannot conceal from ourselves that there is not enough of melody to render it popular, or even greatly pleasing. It is for the few. There is also no small quantity of mannerism. <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">He</a> too frequently forgets, in the search after the philosophical and the sublime, the relative powers of his agents—the voice, which in spite of all the science of the scientifiic, the hearts of a mixed audience pronounce to be the first and chiefest, is too much disregarded and often totally <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">overpowed</span><a class="noteMarker" id="ref-d10e1199" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" data-ref="#d10e1199">‡</a></span>, to make way for the band, the wind instruments especially,<a href="#footnote03" id="backref-footnote03" class="fn-ref">*</a> and the noisy over the more harmonious. The compensation must however be sought and will be found by those who love instrumental effects, in the depth, originality, and force of his conceptions in the employment of the orchestra, in the ingenuity, contrivance, and connection throughout—in short, in the invention and adaptation of what we may call the musical machinery of such operas as <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020040" href="">Der Freischutz</a></span> and <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020045" href="">Oberon</a></span>—the latter being perhaps the most vocal of the two. We nevertheless are compelled to believe that the world will be disappointed—the more so from the previous and possibly exaggerated encomiums on <span class="tei_hi_italic"><a class="preview works A020040" href="">Der Freischutz</a></span>.

                    Before we had concluded this article, Death had taken <a class="preview persons A002068" href="">Weber</a> from us. Our opportunities of seeing and conversing with him<span class="tei_pb" title="Seitenumbruch zu S. 101"> | </span> had not been many, but they were frequent enough and sufficient to make us acquainted with the purity of his mind, with his quiet, ingenuous, and philosophical temper, with his acute power of perception, his strong but mild and rational judgments, and above all with his intense love of his art, which he prosecuted less for the honour and emolument it brings than for itself. He disdained to lower its noble purposes, and wrote with a view to the fame which is bestowed only after the longest and the closest investigation of the merits of the claimant, not to that which is the hasty tribute of the moment of gratification. Peace be to his ashes!
