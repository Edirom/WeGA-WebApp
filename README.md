WeGA WebApp
===========

This web application is written in XQuery on top of an [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org) and powers [www.weber-gesamtausgabe.de](http://www.weber-gesamtausgabe.de). Needless to say the code is tailor-made to fit our data (see `example-data` and the corresponding [TEI ODD schemata](https://github.com/Edirom/WeGA-ODD)) but can hopefully serve as a starting point for likewise ventures.

It is especially _not_ yet designed as an eXist app package but is supposed to run as the only eXist application within one eXist installation.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org/) v1.4.3 (other versions should work, but may need some adjustements) 
2. [Digilib Image Server](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/digilib/) v1.8.3: All processing of images (except icons under `/webapp/pix`) is done via Digilib. Well, if you don't need images, you don't need Digilib. Also, the exact version shouldn't be crucial.


Quick start guide
-----------------

1. Configure eXist
2. Set up Digilib
3. Upload directory `/webapp` to the eXist database root collection
4. Upload directory `/exist-indices/db` to the eXist database `/db/system/config` collection
5. Upload directories under `/example-data` to the eXist database root collection
6. Create a database collection `tmp` under `/db/webapp` and set group and owner to "guest"
7. Direct your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
